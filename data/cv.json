      "abstract": "The hot spots ratio of a domain $Ω\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ measures the degree of failure of Rauch's hot spots conjecture on that domain. We identify the largest possible value of this ratio over all connected Lipschitz domains $Ω\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$, for any dimension $d$. As $d\\to \\infty$, we show that this maximal ratio converges to $\\sqrt{e}$, which asymptotically matches the previous best known upper bound by Mariano, Panzo and Wang. For $d\\ge 2$, we show that sets extremizing the hot spots ratio do not exist, and extremizing sequences must converge to a ball at a quantitative rate. We then give a sharp bound on the measure of the set for which the first Neumann eigenfunction exceeds its maximal boundary value. From this we deduce that the hot spots conjecture is asymptotically true \"in measure'' as $d\\to \\infty$.",

      "abstract": "We investigate the problem of predicting the output behavior of unknown quantum channels. Given query access to an $n$-qubit channel $E$ and an observable $O$, we aim to learn the mapping \\begin{equation*} ρ\\mapsto \\mathrm{Tr}(O E[ρ]) \\end{equation*} to within a small error for most $ρ$ sampled from a distribution $D$. Previously, Huang, Chen, and Preskill proved a surprising result that even if $E$ is arbitrary, this task can be solved in time roughly $n^{O(\\log(1/ε))}$, where $ε$ is the target prediction error. However, their guarantee applied only to input distributions $D$ invariant under all single-qubit Clifford gates, and their algorithm fails for important cases such as general product distributions over product states $ρ$. In this work, we propose a new approach that achieves accurate prediction over essentially any product distribution $D$, provided it is not \"classical\" in which case there is a trivial exponential lower bound. Our method employs a \"biased Pauli analysis,\" analogous to classical biased Fourier analysis. Implementing this approach requires overcoming several challenges unique to the quantum setting, including the lack of a basis with appropriate orthogonality properties. The techniques we develop to address these issues may have broader applications in quantum information.",

      "abstract": "The periodic tiling conjecture asserts that if a region $Σ\\subset \\mathbb R^d$ tiles $\\mathbb R^d$ by translations then it admits at least one fully periodic tiling. This conjecture is known to hold in $\\mathbb R$, and recently it was disproved in sufficiently high dimensions. In this paper, we study the periodic tiling conjecture for polygonal sets: bounded open sets in $\\mathbb R^2$ whose boundary is a finite union of line segments. We prove the periodic tiling conjecture for any polygonal tile whose vertices are rational. As a corollary of our argument, we also obtain the decidability of tilings by rational polygonal sets. Moreover, we prove that any translational tiling by a rational polygonal tile is weakly-periodic, i.e., can be partitioned into finitely many singly-periodic pieces.",

In this work, we establish the following query lower bounds: (1) sampling from strongly log-concave and log-smooth distributions in dimension $d\\ge 2$ requires $Ω(\\log κ)$ queries, which is sharp in any constant dimension, and (2) sampling from Gaussians in dimension $d$ (hence also from general log-concave and log-smooth distributions in dimension $d$) requires $\\widetilde Ω(\\min(\\sqrtκ\\log d, d))$ queries, which is nearly sharp for the class of Gaussians. Here $κ$ denotes the condition number of the target distribution. Our proofs rely upon (1) a multiscale construction inspired by work on the Kakeya conjecture in geometric measure theory, and (2) a novel reduction that demonstrates that block Krylov algorithms are optimal for this problem, as well as connections to lower bound techniques based on Wishart matrices developed in the matrix-vector query literature.",

This generalizes the decoupling theorem of Bourgain-Demeter in the case of the parabola. Due to the sparsity and fractal like structure, this allows us to improve upon Bourgain-Demeter's decoupling theorem for the parabola. In the case when $p/3$ is an even integer we derive theoretical and computational tools to explicitly compute the associated decoupling constant for this projection to $[0, 1]$.

      "abstract": "The analysis of neural network training beyond their linearization regime remains an outstanding open question, even in the simplest setup of a single hidden-layer. The limit of infinitely wide networks provides an appealing route forward through the mean-field perspective, but a key challenge is to bring learning guarantees back to the finite-neuron setting, where practical algorithms operate. Towards closing this gap, and focusing on shallow neural networks, in this work we study the ability of different regularisation strategies to capture solutions requiring only a finite amount of neurons, even on the infinitely wide regime. Specifically, we consider (i) a form of implicit regularisation obtained by injecting noise into training targets [Blanc et al.~19], and (ii) the variation-norm regularisation [Bach~17], compatible with the mean-field scaling. Under mild assumptions on the activation function (satisfied for instance with ReLUs), we establish that both schemes are minimised by functions having only a finite number of neurons, irrespective of the amount of overparametrisation. We study the consequences of such property and describe the settings where one form of regularisation is favorable over the other.",

We apply these models to (1) detect the roles of bicycle-sharing docking stations and (2) describe the traffic within and between blocks of stations over the course of a day. Our models successfully uncover work, home, and other districts; they also reveal activity patterns in these districts that are particular to each city. Our work has direct application to the design and maintenance of bicycle-sharing systems, and it can be applied more broadly to community detection in temporal and multilayer networks with heterogeneous degrees.",

Which point in the object takes the longest to reach this equilibrium? Intuition tells us that points \"in the middle\" of the material will generically reach this equilibrium temperature faster, and points \"far from the middle\" (i.e. at the boundary) should take more time to reach this temperature. The hot spots conjecture is a formalization of this intuition.\n\nRauch initially conjectured that points attaining the maximum temperature in the material would approach the boundary as time goes to infinity. Burdzy and Werner later disproved the conjecture for planar domains with holes. The general consensus, however, was that the conjecture should still hold for convex sets of all dimensions.\n\nThis talk will draw inspiration from a recurrent theme in convex analysis: most dimension-free results in convex analysis have a natural log-concave extension. We will motivate and construct the log-concave analog of the Hot Spots conjecture, and then disprove it. Using this log-concave construction, we will argue that the hot spots conjecture for convex sets is false in high enough dimensions.",

Since then, they have found multiple applications in analysis: from PDEs and restriction theory, to additive number theory, where Bourgain, Demeter and Guth[2] used decoupling-type estimates to prove the main conjecture of the Vinogradov mean value theorem for d>3.\nIn this talk I will explain what decoupling estimates are, I will talk about its applications to the Vinogradov Mean Value theorem and local smoothing, and I will explain the main ingredients that go into (most) decoupling proofs\n[1] Wolff, T.

      "abstract": "The analysis of neural network training beyond their linearization regime remains an outstanding open question, even in the simplest setup of a single hidden-layer. The limit of infinitely wide networks provides an appealing route forward through the mean-field perspective, but a key challenge is to bring learning guarantees back to the finite-neuron setting, where practical algorithms operate. Towards closing this gap, and focusing on shallow neural networks, in this work we study the ability of different regularisation strategies to capture solutions requiring only a finite amount of neurons, even on the infinitely wide regime. Specifically, we consider (i) a form of implicit regularisation obtained by injecting noise into training targets [Blanc et al.~19], and (ii) the variation-norm regularisation [Bach~17], compatible with the mean-field scaling. Under mild assumptions on the activation function (satisfied for instance with ReLUs), we establish that both schemes are minimised by functions having only a finite number of neurons, irrespective of the amount of overparametrisation. We study the consequences of such property and describe the settings where one form of regularisation is favorable over the other.",

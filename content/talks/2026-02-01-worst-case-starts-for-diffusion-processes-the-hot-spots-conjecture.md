  A common way to generate samples from random variables is through diffusion processes. For instance, to obtain a uniformly sampled point on a given set, we run a random walk on the set for a long enough time. For non-uniform random variables, we run the appropriate Langevin dynamics. In practice, this raises a basic worst-case question: where can you start so that mixing (exploration) of the random walk is as slow or "unlucky" as possible? Which initial regions are particularly bad? This question was classically posed by mathematical physicists, in the language of heat flow, as the "Hot Spots" Conjecture. Informally, it predicts that the most extreme behavior should occur at the boundary. The conjecture sits at an intersection of diffusion processes and high-dimensional geometry, and has been understood as a stepping stone toward conjectures such as Kannan–Lovász–Simonovits (KLS). But the Hot Spots Conjecture is false, even for convex sets. In this talk, I'll reinterpret it through a diffusion/sampling lens and explain what its failure really means for algorithms. I'll sketch examples showing that even log-concave targets can exhibit interior "hot" (bad) spots, and then present a systematic way to lift these constructions to convex sets, showing that convex domains can have interior hot spots as well. I'll end by discussing what this does—and does not—suggest about KLS and worst-case behavior in high-dimensional sampling and stochastic optimization.

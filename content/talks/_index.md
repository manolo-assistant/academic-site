  <div class="talk-abstract">
    <p>A common way to generate samples from random variables is through diffusion processes. For instance, to obtain a uniformly sampled point on a given set, we run a random walk on the set for a long enough time. For non-uniform random variables, we run the appropriate Langevin dynamics. In practice, this raises a basic worst-case question: where can you start so that mixing (exploration) of the random walk is as slow or "unlucky" as possible? Which initial regions are particularly bad? This question was classically posed by mathematical physicists, in the language of heat flow, as the "Hot Spots" Conjecture. Informally, it predicts that the most extreme behavior should occur at the boundary. The conjecture sits at an intersection of diffusion processes and high-dimensional geometry, and has been understood as a stepping stone toward conjectures such as Kannan-Lovász-Simonovits (KLS). But the Hot Spots Conjecture is false, even for convex sets. In this talk, I'll reinterpret it through a diffusion/sampling lens and explain what its failure really means for algorithms.</p>

    <p>A homogeneous, insulated object with a non-uniform initial temperature will eventually reach thermal equilibrium. The Hot Spots conjecture addresses which point in the object takes the longest to reach this equilibrium: Where is the maximum temperature attained as time progresses? Rauch initially conjectured that points attaining the maximum temperature would approach the boundary for larger times. Burdzy and Werner disproved the conjecture for planar domains with holes. Kawohl, and later Banuelos- Burdzy, conjectured that the conjecture should still hold for convex sets of all dimensions. This talk will draw inspiration from a recurrent theme in convex anal- ysis: almost every dimension-free result in convex analysis has a natural log-concave extension. We will motivate and construct the log-concave ana- log of the Hot Spots conjecture, and then disprove it. Using this log-concave construction, we will show that the hot spots conjecture for convex sets is false in high dimensions.</p>

  <div class="talk-abstract">
    <p>Generació de variables aleatòries (Jaume de Dios Pont, ETH Zurich). Com generem, en un ordinador, variables aleatòries? Per a algunes variables aleatòries molt concretes (gaussianes, distribucions uniformes...) tenim fórmules per a generar-les eficientment. Però què passa per a variables aleatòries generals en dimensions molt altes? Com a exemple, podem intentar generar un element de la distribució de possibles fotografies de gats. Les imatges de 512px × 512px (×3 colors) són elements d'un espai de gairebé un milió de dimensions. En aquest curs aprendrem alguns dels algorismes més coneguts per a generar variables aleatòries, i veurem la relació d'aquests mètodes amb desigualtats funcionals, teoria espectral, i equacions en derivades parcials.</p>

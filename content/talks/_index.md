  <h3>Worst-case starts for diffusion processes: The hot spots conjecture</h3>

  <div class="talk-abstract">
    <p>A common way to generate samples from random variables is through diffusion processes. For instance, to obtain a uniformly sampled point on a given set, we run a random walk on the set for a long enough time. For non-uniform random variables, we run the appropriate Langevin dynamics. In practice, this raises a basic worst-case question: where can you start so that mixing (exploration) of the random walk is as slow or "unlucky" as possible? Which initial regions are particularly bad? This question was classically posed by mathematical physicists, in the language of heat flow, as the "Hot Spots" Conjecture. Informally, it predicts that the most extreme behavior should occur at the boundary. The conjecture sits at an intersection of diffusion processes and high-dimensional geometry, and has been understood as a stepping stone toward conjectures such as Kannan-Lovász-Simonovits (KLS). But the Hot Spots Conjecture is false, even for convex sets. In this talk, I'll reinterpret it through a diffusion/sampling lens and explain what its failure really means for algorithms.</p>

    <p>A homogeneous, insulated object with a non-uniform initial temperature will eventually reach thermal equilibrium. The Hot Spots conjecture addresses which point in the object takes the longest to reach this equilibrium: Where is the maximum temperature attained as time progresses? Rauch initially conjectured that points attaining the maximum temperature would approach the boundary for larger times. Burdzy and Werner disproved the conjecture for planar domains with holes. Kawohl, and later Banuelos- Burdzy, conjectured that the conjecture should still hold for convex sets of all dimensions. This talk will draw inspiration from a recurrent theme in convex anal- ysis: almost every dimension-free result in convex analysis has a natural log-concave extension. We will motivate and construct the log-concave ana- log of the Hot Spots conjecture, and then disprove it. Using this log-concave construction, we will show that the hot spots conjecture for convex sets is false in high dimensions.</p>

  <div class="talk-abstract">
    <p>Multiple results in harmonic analysis involving integrals of functions over curves (such as restriction theorems, convolution estimates, maximal function estimates or decoupling estimates) depend strongly on the non-vanishing of the torsion of the associated curve. Over the past years there has been considerable interest in extending these results to a degenerate case where the torsion vanishes at a finite number of points by using the affine arc-length as an alternative integration measure. As a model case, multiple results have been proven in which the coordinate functions of the curve are polynomials. In this case one expects the bounds of the operators to depend only on the degree of the polynomial. In this talk I will introduce and motivate the concept of affine arclength measure, provide new decomposition theorems for polynomial curves over characteristic zero local fields, and provide some applications to uniformity results in harmonic analysis.</p>

    <p>Decoupling and discrete restriction inequalities have been very fruitful in recent years to solve problems in additive combinatorics and analytic number theory. In this talk I will present some work in decoupling for Cantor sets, including Cantor sets on a parabola, decoupling for product sets, and give applications of these results to additive combinatorics. Time permitting, I will present some open problems. Based on joint work with Alan Chang, Rachel Greenfeld, Asgar Jamneshan, José Madrid, Zane Li and Paata Ivanisvili</p>

    <p>In this talk we discuss sharp ℓ2L2n estimates for Cantor sets. These estimates are related to the work of Biggs bounding the number of solutions to a certain type of Diophantine equations for integers contained in Ellipsephic sets, sets of numbers missing certain digits in base p. We discuss the connection between both problems, and exploit it to find computational methods to find sharp decoupling estimates. Joint work with A. Chang, R. Greenfeld, A. Jamneshan, Z.K. Li and J.

    <p>Log-concave sampling has witnessed remarkable algorithmic advances in recent years, but the corresponding problem of proving lower bounds for this task has remained elusive, with lower bounds previously known only in dimension one.

    <p>Multiple results in harmonic analysis involving integrals of functions over curves (such as restriction theorems, convolution estimates, maximal function estimates or decoupling estimates) depend strongly on the non-vanishing of the torsion of the associated curve. Over the past years there has been considerable interest in extending these results to a degenerate case where the torsion vanishes at a finite number of points by using the affine arc-length as an alternative integration measure. As a model case, multiple results have been proven in which the coordinate functions of the curve are polynomials. In this case one expects the bounds of the operators to depend only on the degree of the polynomial. In this talk I will introduce and motivate the concept of affine arclength measure, provide new decomposition theorems for polynomial curves over characteristic zero local fields, and provide some applications to uniformity results in harmonic analysis.</p>

  <h3>A Function Space Perspective for Regularised and Overparametrised Shallow ReLU Networks</h3>

  <div class="talk-abstract">
    <p>The analysis of neural network training beyond their linearization regime remains an outstanding open question, even in the simplest setup of a single hidden-layer. The limit of infinitely wide networks provides an appealing route forward through the mean-field perspective, but a key challenge is to bring learning guarantees back to the finite-neuron setting, where practical algorithms operate. Towards closing this gap, and focusing on shallow neural networks, in this work we study the ability of different regularisation strategies to capture solutions requiring only a finite amount of neurons, even on the infinitely wide regime. Specifically, we consider (i) a form of implicit regularisation obtained by injecting noise into training targets [Blanc et al.~19], and (ii) the variation-norm regularisation [Bach~17], compatible with the mean-field scaling. Under mild assumptions on the activation function (satisfied for instance with ReLUs), we establish that both schemes are minimised by functions having only a finite number of neurons, irrespective of the amount of overparametrisation. We study the consequences of such property and describe the settings where one form of regularisation is favorable over the other.</p>

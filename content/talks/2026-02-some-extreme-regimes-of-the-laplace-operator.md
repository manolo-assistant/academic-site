  The Laplace operator plays a central role in the mathematical description of many physical phenomena, such as quantum mechanics, wave propagation, or diffusion processes. This lets us, in many classical settings, use physical intuition to interpret the spectral properties of the Laplace operator on a fixed domain by considering a constant coefficient version of the physical phenomenon at hand.
  
  This talk takes a complementary point of view. We study the behavior of the first few eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator in extreme geometric or asymptotic regimes. In the limit, the operator itself undergoes a qualitative change, recovering variable coefficient physical equations. Depending on the regime, the limiting behavior may be described by an effective Schrödinger operator, a drift–diffusion equation, or a heat equation with an emergent time variable. Such effects arise, for instance, in high dimensional domains, highly perforated or sieve-type domains, as well as in situations where geometric constraints enforce strong localization.
  
  Several classical problems will serve as guiding examples, including questions related to the hot spots and KLS conjectures, homogenization for perforated domains, and rigidity phenomena for eigenfunctions of convex sets. Although these topics are not governed by a single unifying mechanism, they share a common feature: informative spectral behavior becomes visible only in limiting regimes where an effective operator emerges. The goal is to illustrate how pushing the Laplacian into such extreme settings sheds light on localization, geometry, and the structure of low-energy eigenfunctions.

  Log-concave sampling has witnessed remarkable algorithmic advances in recent years, but the corresponding problem of proving lower bounds for this task has remained elusive, with lower bounds previously known only in dimension one.
  In this talk, I will establish query lower bounds for sampling from strongly log-concave and log-smooth distributions in dimension $d\ge 2$, showing that it requires $\Omega(\log \kappa)$ queries, which is sharp in any constant dimension.
  Based on joint work with Sinho Chewi, Jerry Li, Chen Lu, and Shyam Narayanan

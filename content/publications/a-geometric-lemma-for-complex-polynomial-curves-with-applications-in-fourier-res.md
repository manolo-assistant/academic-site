We prove a uniform Fourier restriction estimate for complex polynomial curves equipped with affine arclength measure, extending Stovall's real-variable results to the complex setting.

### Abstract

The aim of this paper is to prove a uniform Fourier restriction estimate for certain $2-$dimensional surfaces in $\mathbb R^{2n}$. These surfaces are the image of complex polynomial curves $γ(z) = (p_1(z), \dots, p_n(z))$, equipped with the complex equivalent to the affine arclength measure. This result is a complex-polynomial counterpart to a previous result by Stovall [Sto16] in the real setting. As a means to prove this theorem we provide an alternative proof of a geometric inequality by Dendrinos and Wright [DW10] that extends the result to complex polynomials.

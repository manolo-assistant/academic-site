We prove uniform Fourier restriction estimates for a new class of curves — those of bounded frequency — using a decomposition scheme connected to techniques from elliptic PDE.

### Abstract

In this paper we prove a uniform Fourier restriction estimate over the class of simple curves where the last coordinate function can be extended to a holomorphic function of bounded frequency in a sufficiently large disc. The proof is based on a decomposition scheme for this class of functions.

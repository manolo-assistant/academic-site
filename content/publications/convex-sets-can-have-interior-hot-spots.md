The hot spots conjecture predicts that the hottest point in an insulated convex body always lies on the boundary. We construct the first counterexamples for convex domains in high dimensions, using a novel extension of the conjecture to log-concave measures.

### Abstract

The hot spots conjecture asserts that for any convex bounded domain $Ω$ in $\mathbb R^d$, the first non-trivial Neumann eigenfunction of the Laplace operator in $Ω$ attains its maximum at the boundary. We construct counterexamples to the conjecture for all sufficiently large values of $d$. The construction is based on an extension of the conjecture from convex sets to log-concave measures.

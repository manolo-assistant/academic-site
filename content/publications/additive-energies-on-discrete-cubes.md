Additive energy measures the arithmetic structure of subsets of abelian groups. We determine the sharp exponent for higher-order energies of subsets of discrete hypercubes {0,1}^d.

### Abstract

We prove that for $d\geq 0$ and $k\geq 2$, for any subset $A$ of a discrete cube $\{0,1\}^d$, the $k-$higher energy of $A$ (the number of $2k-$tuples $(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_{2k})$ in $A^{2k}$ with $a_1-a_2=a_3-a_4=\dots=a_{2k-1}-a_{2k}$) is at most $|A|^{\log_{2}(2^k+2)}$, and $\log_{2}(2^k+2)$ is the best possible exponent. We also show that if $d\geq 0$ and $2\leq k\leq 10$, for any subset $A$ of a discrete cube $\{0,1\}^d$, the $k-$additive energy of $A$ (the number of $2k-$tuples $(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_{2k})$ in $A^{2k}$ with $a_1+a_2+\dots+a_k=a_{k+1}+a_{k+2}+\dots+a_{2k}$) is at most $|A|^{\log_2{ \binom{2k}{k}}}$, and $\log_2{ \binom{2k}{k}}$ is the best possible exponent. We discuss the analogous problems for the sets $\{0,1,\dots,n\}^d$ for $n\geq 2$.

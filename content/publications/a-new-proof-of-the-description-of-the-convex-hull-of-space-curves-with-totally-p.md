Curves with totally-positive torsion generalize convex curves to higher dimensions. We give a new, more geometric proof describing their convex hull, recovering formulas for its surface area and volume.

### Abstract

We give new proofs of the description convex hulls of space curves $γ: [a,b] \mapsto \mathbb{R}^{d}$ having totally positive torsion. These are curves such that all the leading principal minors of $d\times d$ matrix $(γ', γ'', \ldots, γ^{(d)})$ are positive. In particular, we recover parametric representation of the boundary of the convex hull, different formulas for its surface area and the volume of the convex hull, and the solution to a general moment problem corresponding to $γ$.

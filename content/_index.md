## About me

I am a CDS Faculty Fellow at [NYU Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/), working on harmonic analysis, spectral theory, convex geometry, and AI for mathematics.

Previously, I was a postdoc at [ETH Zurich](https://math.ethz.ch) with [Svitlana Mayboroda](https://cse.umn.edu/math/svitlana-mayboroda), funded by the [Simons Collaboration on Localization of Waves](https://cse.umn.edu/wave). I got my PhD from [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/) in 2023, supervised by [Terence Tao](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/). Between PhD and postdoc, I was a research intern at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/) (ML Foundations group).

My name is pronounced [ˈʒawmə], my pronouns are he/him.

## About me

I am a CDS Faculty Fellow at [NYU Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/), working on harmonic analysis, spectral theory, and vaguely related topics.

Previously, I was a Postdoc at [ETHZ](https://math.ethz.ch) with [Svitlana Mayboroda](https://cse.umn.edu/math/svitlana-mayboroda), funded by the [Simons Collaboration on Localization of Waves](https://cse.umn.edu/wave).

I was born in Barcelona, where I lived most of my life. I moved to Los Angeles in 2016 to finish my Bachelor's, and to Zurich in 2017 to pursue a Master's in mathematics. In June 2023 I got my PhD from [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/), under the supervision of [Terence Tao](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/). Between the PhD and the Postdoc, I was a research intern at the [ML Foundations group](http://sbubeck.com/foundations.html) at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/).

My graduate school was supported by a [UCLA dissertation year fellowship](https://grad.ucla.edu/funding/financial-aid/funding-for-continuing-students/dissertation-year-fellowship/), Teaching and Research Assistantships, a ["La Caixa"](https://fundacionlacaixa.org/en/la-caixa-foundation-postgraduate-fellowships-north-america-asia-pacific) post-graduate fellowship, and an [ESOP](https://www.ethz-foundation.ch/en/esop/) fellowship at ETHZ.
